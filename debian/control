Description: Athena libraries for Debian-Athena
 This package recommends a set of libraries for compatibility with a
 default Athena installation.  When installing this package, include
 as many of the recommendations as possible.  If your package manager
 does not do this for you, you can try running these commands after
 intallation:
 .
 aptitude --schedule-only install '~Rrecommends:debathena-athena-libraries!~i+M'
 aptitude --schedule-only install '~i:'
 aptitude -f install
 .
 If you have a customized sources.list that may provide more of the
 needed libraries than the default distribution, rebuild this package
 on your own system to pull them in.
