Description: Athena libraries for Debathena
 This package recommends a set of libraries for compatibility with a
 default Athena 9 installation.  When installing this package, include
 as many of the recommendations as possible.  If your package manager
 does not do this for you, you can try running these commands after
 intallation:
 .
 aptitude --schedule-only install '~Rrecommends:debathena-athena-libraries!~i+M'
 aptitude --schedule-only install '~i:'
 aptitude -f install
 .
 If you have a customized sources.list that may provide more of the
 needed libraries than the default distribution, rebuild this package
 on your own system to pull them in.
